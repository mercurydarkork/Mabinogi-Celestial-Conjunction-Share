I've noticed a lot of people sharing their Celestial Conjunction layouts in really scuffed ways because there is really no good way to share them. So I made this spreadsheet with with dropdown menus so you can easily share your tree and your hand of destiny easier. The sheet won't detect trees that are impossible to create, so build your tree in game and then copy it to the sheet to share it.

this idea from a player .
